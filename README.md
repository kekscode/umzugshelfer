# Umzugshelfer

The umzugshelfer fetches the current external IP address and updates a given cloudflare DNS record.

## Umzugshelfer?

Umzugshelfer is german for relocation assistant. I named it like that because
a) it helps to "relocate" your current DNS ip address entry (old home) to the
new address (new home) and b) i just couldn't come up with a good name illustrating
this use case in english.

## Why?

There are many tools doing this. I wanted to have my own.
